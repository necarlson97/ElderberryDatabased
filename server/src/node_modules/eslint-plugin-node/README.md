Additional ESLint's rules for Node.js

## Install & Usage

```
> npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-node
```

**.eslintrc**

```json
{
    "plugins": ["node"],
    "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:node/recommended"]
}
```

## Configs

This plugin provides `plugin:node/recommended` preset config.
This preset config:

- enables the environment of ES2015 (ES6) and Node.js.
- enables rules which are given :star: in the following table.

**Note:** It recommends a use of [the "engines" field of package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines). The "engines" field is used by [no-unsupported-features](docs/rules/no-unsupported-features.md) rule.
